# Assignment 1
[Assignment 1](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/assets/documents/homework1_handout.pdf), [Data for Assignment 1](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h4664kmmhwaqpn9/AACbrgK3YK7S-wmDqTtIE6TNa?dl=0)

**About This Data:** The data in this homework comes from the [Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR)](https://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/old/STAR.pdf) study in Tennesee. In 1985, a randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted in Tennessee to examine whether students assigned to small classrooms (in this case, 13-17 students) learned more than students assigned to regular-sized classes (in this case 22-25 students). The small classroom is considered the treatmen group. As we cover later in the course, RCT's are the gold standard of establishing the causal effect of a treatment (here, smaller classes) on an outcome of interest (here, student learning as measured by standardized scores). Causal inference generally refers to using statistical methods to approximate RCTs. Since students were randomized into classrooms, they were also, by extension, randomly assigned to teachers. Researchers have also used this data to [examine the impacts of teacher demographics](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/assets/documents/longrun.pdf) on student outcomes, finding potential benefits from increasing diversity in the teacher workforce.

# Assignment 2
[Assignment 2](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/assets/documents/homework2handout.pdf), [Data for Assignment 2](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ton6bo6jt7w8d1y/AAApXhWd61KVyGhRhKeNRxx4a?dl=0)

**About This Data:** The data in this homework comes from the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is an annual survey of a nationally representative sample of households in the United States. It provides rich information about household's earnings, education, use of services, commuting patters, and various other policy relevant characteristics. Researchers and policy-makers look to data from the ACS to investigate all sorts of questions, often times using the geographic information to learn about neighborhood quality effects on individuals' well-being. For instance, [a team of researchers](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18772/w18772.pdf) used data from a randomized control trial involving access to affordable housing in conjunction with neighborhood-level data from the ACS to estimate the effect of various neighborhood characteristics on long-term outcomes for low-income people.

# Assignment 3
[Assignment 3](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/assets/documents/homework3handout.pdf), [Data for Assignment 3](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0yjpw20fbpp26ii/AABKH2wW-2BpPBXLsIDguJkka?dl=0)

**About This Data:** The data in this homework comes from the [Public-Police Contact Survey](https://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/police-public-contact-survey-ppcs) (PPCS), conducted and maintained periodically by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The PPCS collects data from a nationally representative sample of people who had contact with the police, either through reporting a crime or during a traffic stop, and collects information about the respondent, the stop, the outcome from the stop, and how the respondent felt about various aspects of their interaction with the police. Researchers have [used this in the past](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/696355) to examine how contacts with police vary by race and gender. The extra credit for this assignment uses data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002. I have worked with the ELS extensively, using it to document [racial disparities in teacher expectations](https://stevebholt.github.io/files/GershensonHoltPapageorgeEER.pdf) and [how experience might change this](https://stevebholt.github.io/files/VinopalHolt2019ER.pdf), examine the role of [base of motivation in workers' sector preferences](https://stevebholt.github.io/files/Holt2018PAR.pdf), [how schools shape prosocial motivation](https://stevebholt.github.io/files/Holt2018IPMJ.pdf), and examine the link between [intergroup contact and prosocial motivation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0734371X20966652). Obviously, panel data can be extremely useful for researchers in answering a wide range of questions.

# Assignment 4 - Extra Credit
[Assignment 4](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/assets/documents/homework4handout.pdf), [Data for Assignment 4](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r46xm6jfqcir75f/AAD8-87DKM7mmmd7QQ1VaN6Oa?dl=0)

**About This Data:** The data in this homework comes from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a nationally representative survey of voting age adults that is fielded before and after every federal election. The data provides a lot of information about voters, voting-aged adults, and how they think about the country, policy, ideology, and party preferences. Political scientists often rely on this data to get a sense of how the electorate has changed over time, how state policies or legislative priorities shift voting coalitions, and a wide range of other important insights about our democracy and its voters. Recent work has used the CCES to study [the sources of polarization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0002764212463352?casa_token=m1YJEQZkoSoAAAAA:oBXQSA74EjlbUVlwGUAUrTru_E3CKzPLyfXz0u1h_CiSusZz9v8XySp6-94tit6b9kG-SWbeL8bXYg), the extent to which [geographic sorting contributes to polarization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1532673X10396303?casa_token=6C0KdNsRm04AAAAA:x8N119jn3k2REeaR2UUqz-JCOoYb4poWnENSeXoNbHo7nsorYfmc7fMem3BC0Zl4RjEwo5EL5nyK1Q), [framing effects on support for automatic voter registration](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X20922525?casa_token=rHZVmf8rQsEAAAAA:7IwVIhyJBw_tw6bw3R8Cr360sWnzYN0gpJRlYzJKrTFmJgFxiCCEXW4F7TPQnDKBjtULAkjI8n_zpQ), and [racial attitudes in the electorate](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/fear-institutionalized-racism-and-empathy-the-underlying-dimensions-of-whites-racial-attitudes/F6205AFDA74F11AAAA518DA240AC7995). I have used data from the CCES to consider whether [altruism or public service motivation better explain volunteerism](https://stevebholt.github.io/files/PiatakHolt2019JPART.pdf) and how [public service motivation might correspond with policy preferences](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/abs/public-service-motivation-and-public-opinion/0BBE98D237FF784AD3BCA0E3C2032D9E).
