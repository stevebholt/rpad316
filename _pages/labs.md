# Class Lab 1
[Class Lab 1](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/labs/class-lab-1/), [Data for Lab 1](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p9x5rg03bft9pz9/AABMoSaA23QHWRs7H0Yr4wrHa?dl=0)

**In This Lab:** We cover the basic elements of the Stata workspace, lay out a workflow for conducting analysis in Stata, handle creating and labeling variables, make some basic graphs, and learn to estimate simple summary statics of variables. We use data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to work through these examples in Stata.

**In This Lab:** We review project workflow, making basic graphs, and summary statistics and move into graphing the relationship between two continuous variables with scatterplots and estimating Pearson's R coefficient. We use data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to work through these examples in Stata.

# Class Lab 3
[Class Lab 3](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/labs/class-lab-3/), [Data for Lab 3](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/084t1a7idu856vm/AABiNmizS785oHW9Pjlj7wcCa?dl=0)
**In This Lab:** We review graphing and estimating relationships between two continuous variables, and then we cover how to examine relationships between categorical variables using two-way tables. We use data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) to work through these examples in Stata.
