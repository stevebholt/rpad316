# Class Lab 1
## [Class Lab 1](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/labs/class-lab-1/) 
## [Data for Lab 1](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p9x5rg03bft9pz9/AABMoSaA23QHWRs7H0Yr4wrHa?dl=0)

**In This Lab:** We cover the basic elements of the Stata workspace, lay out a workflow for conducting analysis in Stata, handle creating and labeling variables, make some basic graphs, and learn to estimate simple summary statics of variables. We use data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to work through these examples in Stata.

## [Data for Lab 2](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tl9c3j11e5jwwxy/AACsCL39upFd1EGbhuDc6ibwa?dl=0)

**In This Lab:** We review project workflow, making basic graphs, and summary statistics and move into graphing the relationship between two continuous variables with scatterplots and estimating Pearson's R coefficient. We use data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to work through these examples in Stata.
