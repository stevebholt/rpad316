Weclome to the course page for Methodological Tools for Public Policy! The course will provide a gentle introduction to statistics and research design with an eye toward applications in the world of policy analysis. This course page is where you'll find the handouts from class labs that we work through together in class as a reference for helping with problem sets and studying. You'll also find the dataset for replicating our labs and the data needed for the problem sets here. The syllabus to the course can be found [here](https://stevebholt.github.io/rpad316/assets/documents/PAD316_S22_Syllabus.pdf).
